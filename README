Hello World
Welcome to the BarbieDreamHouse Repository!

Below are directions on how to get yourself setup with your very own repository so you can get hands on experience with working with git.
By creating your own copy of the Dream House remote repository, you can work through the exercise of cloning a remote repo to your computer, modifying files on your computer, and 
The first part of these directions are for setting up Git, which is required, and VSCode. I recommend starting with VSCode as it can be your text editor, command line, and GUI all in one

Set up your tools:
1. Follow directions for downloading Git onto your computer: https://git-scm.com/download
2. Follow directions for installing VS Code: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quickstart-vscode-salesforce/start-vscode NOTE: setting up vscode to work with Salesforce isn't required for using git (parts 2 and 3 of the trailhead), I recommend setting it up and learning that as well!
3. Create a GitHub account: github.com

Create a copy of the Dream House remote repository in GitHub:
1. On your home dashboard in github click Create Repository. The only information you need to enter is a name.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page to where it says "â€¦or import code from another repository" and click Import Code
3. Copy and paste https://github.com/greerzimm1010/DreamHouse.git into the URL field and click Begin Import
4. Once Import is complete, click the name of your repository and you will be taken to your very own DreamHouse remote repository with four files:
    Barbie
    Ken
    Skipper
    Teresa

Clone your remote Dream House repo to your local computer
1. Open VSCode. On the Welcome screen click CLone Git Repository
2. Click Clone From GitHub in the menu that drops down from the search bar
3. A window will pop up saying "The extension GitHub wants to sign in using 'GitHub'" - click Allow and follow prompts to login
4. In the menu that drops down from the search bar, select your repository
5. You will see 4 new files appear in the left hand Explorer panel in VSCode

Start using git!
I highly recommend watching this video to get yourself familiar with the basics of using git in VSCode. It covers the same topics we covered in the presentation - and more!
