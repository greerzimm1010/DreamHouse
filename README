Hello World
Welcome to the BarbieDreamHouse Repository!

Below are directions on how to get yourself setup with your very own repository so you can get hands on experience with working with git.

Getting your tools setup: I recommend you get started with VSCode as your code development tool. It is an IDE, which can be your text editor, command line, and GUI all in one. That is what I cover in my directions below. However, if you have other tools you want to try, all you really need is a github account and you can begin on line 16 for directions on how to copy the BarbieDreamHouse repo.

Follow directions for downloading Git onto your computer: https://git-scm.com/download
Follow directions for setting up VS Code: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quickstart-vscode-salesforce/start-vscode NOTE: setting up vscode to work with Salesforce isn't required for using git (parts 2 and 3 of the trailhead), I recommend setting it up and learning that as well!
Create a GitHub account: github.com
Once your tools are setup, you can clone the BarbieDreamHouse repository:

On your home dashboard in github click Create Repository. The only information you need to enter is a name.
Scroll to the bottom of the page to where it says "â€¦or import code from another repository" and click Import Code
Copy and paste https://github.com/greerzimm1010/BarbieDreamHouse.git into the URL field and click Begin Import
Once Import is complete you will see the message
Click the name of your repository and you will be taken to your very own BarbeDreamHouse repository with four files. You are now ready to get starting working with git!
Cloning your remote repo to your local computer

Open VSCode. On the Welcome screen click CLone Git Repository
Click Clone From GitHub in the menu that drops down from the search bar
A window will pop up saying "The extension GitHub wants to sign in using 'GitHub'" - click Allow and follow prompts to login
In the menu that drops down from the search bar, select the BarbieDreamHouse repository
